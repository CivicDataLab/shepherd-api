HVD_NOTE = "Methodology for calculating ratings for each header of this report is as follows
Technical Interoperability - This is based on the format percentage of the distributions in a dataset. The priority is given in the order - CSV, JSON, XML and PDF. If the percentage of CSV - distributions is more in a dataset, the score will be more. Suppose all the distributions are of csv type i.e. 100%, the dataset will get full score.
Timeliness - More the update frequency, more is the score. Daily updated datasets get the highest score and one time updated datasets get the least score..
User rating - This is calculated based on the average user ratings for the datasets. More the user rating, more the score.
User Interaction - This is calculated based on the number of user interactions on a dataset.
Downloads rating - More the number of downloads in a dataset, more is the score. This shall include both files and API downloads.
Downloads per month - This, as the name suggests is the average number of downloads per month. This is calculated using downloads' count and the dataset - publish date.
Total rating - This is the sum of all the above stated ratings.
